                        I am Manuel Eduardo Sotelo Cervantes.
                        I was born in Los Mochis Sinaloa, Mexico.
                        Brought to the United States at 1 year old to Los Angeles, California.
                        Finally, I now reside in San Antonio, Texas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in the service industry thanks to my uncle's mexican seafood restaurant
                        <a class="tertiary" href="https://el-bucanero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El
                            Bucanero</a>.
                        Since I was a kid I was running around the kitchen playing with knives, stacking inventory boxes
                        to play on, or bother the serving staff for $1.
                        Since Middle School, I have worked every weekend to start growing my little bank account.
                        Then, I got to High School.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>System.out.println("Hello World");</i><br>
                        I know this sounds cliche, however; this is what sparked my facination and endless persuit for
                        programming knowledge.
                        This simple output line changed the direction of my career.
                        I knew from the moment <i>Hello World</i> appeared on my school output window, I knew I was
                        going to dedicate everything into software development.

                        I attended Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio, Texas.
                        In my four years of high school, I was honored to be a part of the UIL Physics team, UIL
                        Robotics team, and the award winning band program.
                        This is where I explored Calculus, Java Programming Language, Robotics programming, Arduino,
                        Mechanical Physics, Electricticity and Magnetism, and many more subjects.
                        Ronald Reagan High School set me on my trajectory to be the man I am today.

                        San Antonio Community College is where I started my first year of community college.
                        I do not have my associates degree, I plan on returning back to college and completing my
                        degree.
                        Eventually, I would like to get my bachelor's degree as well.

                    <p>
                        While taking a break from San Antonio Community college, I decided to commit six months to
                        complete the <i>Data Analytics and Visualization Programming Boot Camp</i>.
                        Here is where a large amount of my projects come from. <a href="/projects.html">Check out all of
                            my projects here!</a>
                        This phenomenal program eventually provided me my first teaching assistant role.
                        Furthermore it has given me great connections to many knowledgeable beautiful people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The boot camp let me use my rapid learning skills to absorb information that is normally
                        presented over several years.
                        The curriculum includes: Excel, VBA, Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, API's, PostgreSQL, MongoDb,
                        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask, Plotly JS, D3, Tableau, Supervised ML, Unsupervised ML, Neural
                        Networks, and Big Data with PySpark.

                    <p>
                        This certification provided me the understanding of fundamental AWS services, as well as how the
                        cloud works.
                        After the certification I was able to utilize: Amazon S3, IAM, KMS, Amazon's Pay as you go
                        pricing, and Amazon CloudWatch.
                        Although the AWS website recommends <i>Six months of exposure to the AWS Cloud</i>, I learned
                        the subject in two days, took the test on the third day, and was certified on that third day.

                            During my time with Accenture, I was part of a Scrum Team which handled the functionality of the Amazon Connect Contact Center.
                            Our daily standups would ensure that we held each other accountable for the tests we were preparing.
                            I worked alongside offshore and onshore team to design different tests of the Contact Center.
                            We utillized tools to automate the artificial inbound calls to the Contact Center.
                            I helped design and validate colleagues work for accurate Contact Center call flows.
                            Furthermore, I created automated tests to simulate human behavior and human clicking with Selenium.
                            The code I wrote in Selenium was written from scratch to address the specific parts we were testing.
                            All of the code was shared internally and version controlled with Git and BitBucket.

                            My time with Accenture was cut short unfortunately.
                            I created some very special relationships with the people I was barely getting to know.
                            The funding for my contract had run dry and I was no longer able to be a part of the amazing team.

                            href="https://genspark.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GenSpark</a> for training me and certifying in Amazon Connect. 
                            You may notice the overlap in the timelines from Accenture.
                            GenSpark is the contracting company that sent me out with Accenture.

                            I was let go from GenSpark when my contract with Accenture ended and we were not able to locate a new contract.

                            href="https://pappadeaux.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pappadeaux</a> for great memories and an awesome fancy dining staff experience.
                            During my time with Pappadeaux, I was able to fill in the shoes of all the staff in front of the restaurant.
                            I would even assist management when dealing with situations they were not able to address or handle in a timely manner.
                            As I mentioned above, I grew up in the service industry.
                            Moving to Pappadeaux was the next step in the Fine dining industry.
                            Here I elevated my customer experience, learned many customer service skills, and took leadership over the serving staff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although it was never published, nor sold to the restaurant, I created an Android Application to centralize the closing duties for the wait staff and management.
                            Rather than dealing with pen and paper reports, I offered them a system which would automate the mathematical equations the managers would do, offer a centralized place to house the data through AWS.
                            unfortunately, the application never launched.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I departed from Pappadeaux when I began my first IT job with Accenture.
