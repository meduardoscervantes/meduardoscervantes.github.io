                        I am Manuel Eduardo Sotelo Cervantes.
                        I was born in Los Mochis Sinaloa, Mexico.
                        Brought to the United States at 1 year old to Los Angeles, California.
                        Finally, I now reside in San Antonio, Texas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in the service industry thanks to my uncle's mexican seafood restaurant
                        <a class="tertiary" href="https://el-bucanero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El
                            Bucanero</a>.
                        Since I was a kid I was running around the kitchen playing with knives, stacking inventory boxes
                        to play on, or bother the serving staff for $1.
                        Since Middle School, I have worked every weekend to start growing my little bank account.
                        Then, I got to High School.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>System.out.println("Hello World");</i><br>
                        I know this sounds cliche, however; this is what sparked my facination and endless persuit for
                        programming knowledge.
                        This simple output line changed the direction of my career.
                        I knew from the moment <i>Hello World</i> appeared on my school output window, I knew I was
                        going to dedicate everything into software development.

                        I attended Ronald Reagan High School in San Antonio, Texas.
                        In my four years of high school, I was honored to be a part of the UIL Physics team, UIL
                        Robotics team, and the award winning band program.
                        This is where I explored Calculus, Java Programming Language, Robotics programming, Arduino,
                        Mechanical Physics, Electricticity and Magnetism, and many more subjects.
                        Ronald Reagan High School set me on my trajectory to be the man I am today.

                        After High School, I continued my higher eduaction journey at San Antonio's Alamo Colleges.
                        San Antonio Community College is where I started my first year of community college.
                        I do not have my associates degree, I plan on returning back to college and completing my
                        degree.
                        Eventually, I would like to get my bachelor's degree as well.

                        While taking a break from San Antonio Community college, I decided to commit six months to complete the <i>Data Analytics and Visualization Programming Boot Camp</i>.
                        Here is where a large amount of my projects come from. <a href="/projects.html">Check out all of my projects here!</a>
                        This phenomenal program eventually provided me my first teaching assistant role.
                        Furthermore it has given me great connections to many knowledgeable beautiful people.

                    <p>
                        The boot camp let me use my rapid learning skills to absorb information that is normally presented over several years.
                        The curriculum includes: Excel, VBA, Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, API's, PostgreSQL, MongoDb, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask, Plotly JS, D3, Tableau, Supervised ML, Unsupervised ML, Neural Networks, and Big Data with PySpark.

                        Amazon's Certified Cloud Practitioner.
                        This certification provided me the understanding of fundamental AWS services, as well as how the cloud works.
                        After the certification I was able to utilize: Amazon S3, IAM, KMS, Amazon's Pay as you go pricing, and Amazon CloudWatch.
                        Although the AWS website recommends <i>Six months of exposure to the AWS Cloud</i>, I learned the subject in two days, took the test on the third day, and was certified on that third day.
